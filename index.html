<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Winona and I am University of Minnesota student majoring in Technical Writing. </p>
<p>I just got married in June 2017, have two dogs, and enjoy eating out. My personal goal by the end of this year is to have a cleaner and healthier lifestyle in terms of food and exercise.
