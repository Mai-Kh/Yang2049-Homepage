<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Winona and I am University of Minnesota student majoring in Technical Writing. </p>
<p>I just got married in June 2017, have two dogs, and enjoy reading. Yesterday, I just finished a book called "A Lesson Before Dying," by Ernest J. Gaines. It was a great book--I finished it in two days. Aside from reading X number of good books, my personal goal by the end of this year is to have a cleaner and healthier lifestyle.</p>
